}
\source{
Fictitious data
}
\usage{
sample_no_continuity
}
\description{
A variant of \code{\link{sample_data}} in which no candidate appears in more
than one election. This breaks the continuity between elections, making it
useful for testing whether network-building functions correctly handle datasets
with no longitudinal links between candidate lists.
